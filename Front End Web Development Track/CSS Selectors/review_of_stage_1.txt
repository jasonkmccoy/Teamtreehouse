1. Attribute selectors can target an element by any of its HTML attributes

2. DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself

3. We can define specific child and sibling selectors with combinators:
    a. > targets a direct child of an element
    b. + targets immediate siblings
    c. ~ targets all the specified siblings that follow an element
